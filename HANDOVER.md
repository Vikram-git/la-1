# Handover — La Patisserie order management

Date: 2026-10-05 (first written 2026-09-27). Read this first, then [TODO.md](TODO.md) ("Start here"), [PRD.md](PRD.md), and [PROJECT_RULES.md](PROJECT_RULES.md). Designs and plans for recent work are in `docs/superpowers/specs/` and `docs/superpowers/plans/`. The project folder and repository still carry the old working name "Auri Bakery"; the owner chose **La Patisserie** on 2026-10-03.

**State on 2026-10-09:** the owner asked for KOT to be removed, Customers in its place, customer orders, custom cake orders, product photos, and collect-or-set-up with green/red highlights. That work is **built and tested on branch `no-kot-custom-cakes`, not yet merged, deployed or applied to the live database** (section 19 lists the owner steps). `main` (`b4e9eae`) is what is live: everything up to 2026-10-05, with every migration up to `20261003000900` applied. Mock-up pieces 3 (product photos) and 4 (custom cake details) are done on the branch; piece 2 (Orders page like the mock-up) is still to do.

## 1. Where things stand

| Phase | State | What exists |
|---|---|---|
| 0–2 Planning | Mostly done | PRD v0.3, rules, TODO. Many business decisions still open (PRD section 14, TODO Phase 0). |
| 3 Foundation | **Done** | Staff login, roles, kitchens, products/variants/categories, settings, audit log. |
| 4A Orders | **Done** | In-store and call orders, two order lists, order detail, confirm/reject/cancel/reschedule, payments and refunds, calendar, opening hours and closures, customers. |
| 4B Billing | **Done** | Counter quick sale, discounts, GST bills (gap-free per financial year), credit notes, 80mm and A4 print. |
| 4C | **Done except notifications** | Pickup windows, category caps, festival overrides, shared override prompt, calendar views, demo-login buttons, customer blocking and no-shows (section 9), item edits (section 10). Left: notification templates (owner to choose a channel). |
| 5A Kitchen tickets | **Removed (owner, 2026-10-09; on the branch)** | Was: tickets per kitchen, chef screen, KOT page (sections 11–12, 14, 16 are now history). Confirming makes no ticket; staff pack when ready (section 19). |
| 5B Packing and handover | **Done, deployed** | Packing → Ready; handover → Completed with the balance check and a GST bill; admin reopen and credit handover (section 13). **Defaults need the owner's confirmation** (section 6). |
| 5C Kitchen revisions | **Done, reviewed, deployed** | Changes after the kitchen acknowledged: tickets revised in place, Changed banner to acknowledge, packing waits (section 14). |
| 5D Chef PIN sign-in | **Removed with KOT (on the branch)** | Chef logins and kitchen tablets no longer have access (section 19). |
| 6 Public website | Not started | Deferred by the owner. Offers & Banners and Reviews belong to it. |
| 7 Reports and Home | **Done, deployed** | Daily sales report with CSV and GST split (section 15); Home with kitchen workload and alerts (section 17). |
| Owner's mock-up | **Pieces 1, 3, 4 done** (3 and 4 on the branch) | Look and shell (section 18); product photos and custom cake orders (section 19). Left: 2 Orders page like the mock-up → 5 notifications → 6 delivery (set-up at the customer's place now covers part of it). |
| 2026-10-09 changes | **Built, tested, not deployed** | No KOT; Customers for counter staff; Customer order source; custom cake orders (photo, price, advance, sticky note, cake sheet); product photos; collect / set up with green and red highlights (section 19). |
| 8–9 | Not started | Rehearsal, launch, Release 1.1 exceptions. |

**Browser checks so far:** automated headless-Chrome screenshots of login, Dashboard, Orders, KOT, Reports, a coming-soon page, the phone menu and the kitchen tablet (2026-10-04), plus HTTP-level checks of the PIN pages and live smoke tests of PIN sign-in. **No one has yet clicked through the real flows** (taking, confirming, changing, packing and handing over an order; the chef screen on a tablet; prints on an 80mm printer). The owner wants that walkthrough last, after the build work; it is the biggest remaining risk (section 8).

**The live database holds demo data** (owner's request, 2026-10-03): 16 demo products in 5 categories, 15 orders B-1001…B-1015 in every state (completed with bills AB/2026-27/00001–00005 and one credit note, preparing, a change awaiting the kitchen, packed awaiting pickup, cancelled with stop-work, rejected, pending, an open kitchen issue), 12 demo customers. Staff: Demo Admin and Demo Chef (both kitchens). Load with `supabase/seed/demo_data.sql`; **before real data goes in, run `supabase/seed/remove_demo_data.sql`** (SQL editor or MCP): it deletes every demo order, bill, payment, customer and product and restarts numbering at B-1001 and bill 00001. Run SQL tests locally (section 5), not on the live project.

### Owner decisions to keep in mind

- **No stock or inventory tracking** (owner, 2026-10-02). Ready-stock items are sold without counts or allocation records. Do not design stock counts into any phase, including 5B packing.
- **No KOT** (owner, 2026-10-09): no kitchen tickets, chef screen or chef logins. Orders go Confirmed → Packed → Handed over.
- **Collect or set up** (owner, 2026-10-09): every order is collected from the store (green) or set up at the customer's place (red, needs the address), shown everywhere orders appear.
- **Recording a no-show never changes the order's status.**
- **Brand: La Patisserie** (owner, 2026-10-03), chef-hat logo, tagline "More than cakes, sweeter moments"; decoration everywhere including the kitchen tablet; unbuilt screens shown as "Coming soon".
- **Delivery is wanted after all** (owner, 2026-10-03, reversing pickup-only): build it as piece 6; ask the owner for the rules (charge, area, who delivers) then.
- **Chef PINs** (owner, 2026-10-03): set by an admin; tablets never lock by themselves; no lock-out after wrong PINs.
- **Sales report: admins only** (owner, 2026-10-03).
- **Changes after the kitchen acknowledged** (owner, 2026-10-03): the ticket keeps its status and ready counts and shows the exact changes, which the kitchen acknowledges; packing waits for that. Lowering a quantity below what is already made caps the ready count; nothing records the extra (no waste or counter-sale record).

## 2. Accounts and access

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| Supabase project | `auri-bakery`, ref `hljkydruionasnouyrpu`, region ap-south-1 (Mumbai), in the owner's Supabase organisation. Ask the owner to invite you. |
| Demo admin login | `demo@auri.test`. The password is in `web/.admin-password.txt` on the owner's machine; it is git-ignored. Get it from the owner privately. `@auri.test` cannot receive emails, so create a real admin before go-live and disable this one. |
| Demo chef login | `chef@auri.test`, created 2026-10-03, assigned to Kitchen 1 and Kitchen 2. The password and the kitchen-tablet PIN are in `web/.admin-password.txt` (git-ignored); `web/.env.local` has `DEMO_CHEF_*` (so local `/login` shows a Demo chef button). Not yet on Vercel. |
| Demo-login buttons | `/login` shows "Demo admin" / "Demo chef" buttons that fill the form while `DEMO_ADMIN_*` / `DEMO_CHEF_*` are set (owner's choice, including production). **Production has `DEMO_ADMIN_*` only** (set 2026-10-03), so anyone who opens the live site can sign in as the demo admin. Local `web/.env.local` has both. **Delete them on Vercel and redeploy before real data goes in.** |
| Secret key | In `web/.env.local` as `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` (2026-10-03). **Not on Vercel yet**: production needs it for chef PIN sign-in and for creating staff logins and resetting passwords there (`vercel env add SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY production` from `web/`, then redeploy). It was pasted in a chat session, so **rotate it before go-live** (Supabase → API Keys) and update both places. Never commit it. |
| Publishable key and URL | Already in `web/.env.local` (safe for browsers). `web/.env.example` documents all variables. |
| Hosting | Vercel project `bakery-admin` (team "sandymandycandy's projects"), root `web/`, production at **https://bakery-admin-ten.vercel.app**. **Git integration connected 2026-10-03:** pushes to `main` deploy to production; other branches get preview deployments. The first Git deployment (2026-10-03) built nothing and served 404s until the project's **Root Directory was set to `web`** (done 2026-10-03, with framework Next.js). **The 5C merge push (`9ab84fc`) did not start a deployment**; it was deployed by hand through the API (`POST /v13/deployments` with `gitSource` for `main`). After a push, check `vercel ls` (from `web/`) shows a new Production deployment; if not, check the GitHub app connection in the Vercel dashboard. Production env vars today: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `DEMO_ADMIN_EMAIL`, `DEMO_ADMIN_PASSWORD`. Manual deploys, if ever needed, run from the repository root (Root Directory is `web`). `web/vercel.json` pins the Next.js preset (without it the site served only 404s). |
| Version control | GitHub: `sandymandycandy/bakery-admin`. `main` holds all work; every feature branch is merged (old local branches `phase-4c-*`, `phase-5a-*` and remote `claude/exciting-goldberg-09thku` can be deleted). Secrets (`web/.env.local`, `web/.admin-password.txt`) are git-ignored and must be shared separately. |


## 3. Running it

```bash
cd web
npm install
npm run dev            # http://localhost:3000 → redirects to /login
npm run typecheck      # next typegen + tsc
npm run lint
npm test               # unit tests (Node's built-in runner, src/**/*.test.ts)
npm run build
npm run create-admin -- --email you@example.com --name "Your Name" [--role admin|counter|chef]   # needs SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY
```

Node 22 is used (22.18+ runs the `.ts` tests directly). There is no Docker, so there is no local Supabase; the app talks to the hosted project.

The SQL rule checks do not need the hosted project. On any PostgreSQL 16+ where you are a superuser:

```bash
supabase/local/run-tests.sh                  # every check file (or name some: run-tests.sh packing_logic)
supabase/local/concurrency-kitchen.sh        # two-session lock-order check
```

**No PostgreSQL on the machine?** `supabase/local/pglite/` runs the same checks on PGlite (Postgres compiled to WebAssembly, in Node): `cd supabase/local/pglite && npm install && node run.mjs [names…]`. It needs Python for `check_results.py`. The 2026-10-03 5C results come from it; it reproduces every earlier result.

`run-tests.sh` builds a scratch database from `supabase/local/shim.sql` (stand-ins for Supabase's `auth` schema and API roles) plus every migration, runs each `supabase/tests/*.sql`, and compares every outcome with the file's `-- expect:` comments. Checks without a machine-checkable expectation (most of `orders_logic` and `billing_logic`) are printed for a person to read.

**If `npm run dev` returns 500 on every page** with a Turbopack panic about `globals.css` (`node process exited … 0xc0000142`), start with `npx next dev --webpack` instead. This happened from a sandboxed agent shell on the owner's machine; it may not affect a normal terminal. Production builds on Vercel are unaffected.

**Next.js 16 is newer than most training data and tutorials.** `web/AGENTS.md` points to the bundled docs in `web/node_modules/next/dist/docs/`. Notable differences: `middleware.ts` is now `src/proxy.ts`; `params`/`searchParams` are Promises; `PageProps<"/route">` and `LayoutProps` are global types generated by `next typegen`. The `react-hooks/purity` lint rule rejects `Date.now()` during render.

### How writes work (important)

- **Catalogue, staff, settings, hours, and closures** are written directly through Supabase with row-level security (RLS). Only admins can write.
- **Orders, payments, bills, credit notes, customers' flags, and kitchen tickets can only be written through Postgres functions.** Staff have **no insert or update grants** on those tables.
  - Orders and money: `create_order`, `confirm_order`, `reject_order`, `cancel_order`, `reschedule_order`, `update_order_items`, `record_payment`, `apply_discount`, `issue_bill`, `issue_credit_note`, `counter_sale`, `record_no_show`, `undo_no_show`, `set_customer_blocked`, and (5B) `mark_packed`, `reopen_packing`, `record_handover`.
  - Kitchen: `acknowledge_ticket`, `start_ticket`, `set_line_ready`, `report_issue`, `resolve_issue`, `acknowledge_stop_work`, `record_ticket_print`. Read-only: `ticket_stamp` (the chef screen's change check).
- Order functions check the caller's role, validate everything, take an **idempotency key** where a retry could duplicate, take the order **version** so concurrent edits fail with "conflict", and write an `order_events` timeline row.
- Kitchen functions take **no version**: each states an end result ("12 ready", "started"), so repeats and double taps change nothing. Admins may act on tickets only as an exception with a reason (at least 5 characters).
- **Lock order: the order first, then its tickets.** `private.lock_order` locks the order (`for update`); chef actions go through `private.lock_ticket`, which locks the order (`for no key update`) before the ticket, and `private.kitchen_guard` locks the order's tickets before it checks them. Keep this order in new functions, or an admin edit and a chef tap on the same order can deadlock (`supabase/local/concurrency-kitchen.sh` reproduces it without the fix).
- The functions are `SECURITY DEFINER` in `public`. The Supabase advisor warns about this; it is intentional (they are the only write path and each checks the role). Helpers live in the unexposed `private` schema.
- Errors use `private.fail(message, kind)`. The message is written for staff; `kind` travels in the Postgres `hint` field (`slot`, `lead_time`, `capacity`, `conflict`, `forbidden`, `unmapped`, `billed`, `blocked`, `unavailable`, `kitchen`, …). `web/src/lib/orders.ts → rpcError` maps them; `slot`, `lead_time`, `blocked` and `capacity` show the shared `OverridePrompt`, where admins retry with a reason. `kitchen` is deliberately not overridable.
- Every table has an audit trigger (`audit_events`: who, what, before, after).

### Invariants — do not break

- Money is **integer paise** everywhere. Prices are **GST-inclusive**; tax is the included portion per line.
- Order lines are **snapshots**: catalogue edits never change existing orders. Kitchen ticket lines are snapshots of order lines.
- All scheduling uses the **business timezone** from `business_settings` (Asia/Kolkata). Convert with `web/src/lib/time.ts`; never use the server's or browser's zone.
- Payments are an **append-only ledger**: corrections are refunds. Bills and credit notes are **immutable**, and bill numbers are **gap-free per financial year** (April–March) via `document_sequences`. A billed order cannot be cancelled until fully credited.
- Chefs see **only kitchen tickets for their assigned kitchens** (`staff_kitchens`) and never orders, payments, customers, order events, bills or prices.
- Balances come from the `order_summaries` view: total − credit notes − payments + refunds. Cancelled and rejected orders charge nothing, so a negative balance means a refund is due.
- `order_summaries` is built with `o.*`, which Postgres expands when the view is created. It was last recreated on 2026-10-03 (`20261003000500`), so it has every `orders` column up to 5B; a column added to `orders` later is missing until the view is recreated (drop and create, then the same grants).

### Database migrations

Files in `supabase/migrations/` were applied to the live project in order through the Supabase MCP server. The CLI is not linked. To continue:

- Install the Supabase CLI and run `supabase link --project-ref hljkydruionasnouyrpu`. Check that the remote migration history matches the files (names: `foundation`, `orders`, `billing`, `bill_gst_split_per_rate`, `bill_gst_split_integer_division`, `counter_sale_precheck`, `capacity`, `capacity_enforcement`, `capacity_review_fixes`, `no_shows`, `edit_order_items`, `kitchen_tickets`, `kitchen_review_fixes`, `packing_handover`).
  - The last GST-split fix was applied as `bill_gst_split_integer_division`, but its file is `20260927000310_bill_gst_split_per_rate.sql` (the file already contains the fixed version). Reconcile the history names when linking.
- New tables in `public` get full API access by default in Supabase. Every migration so far **revokes** that and grants only what is needed; keep doing this, and enable RLS on every table.
- When a migration replaces an existing function, copy its **latest** definition (later migrations redefine `confirm_locked`, `reschedule_order`, `cancel_order`, `update_order_items`) and change only what you need.
- After schema changes, update `web/src/lib/database.types.ts`. It was condensed by hand from generated output (write-only-by-function tables are `Insert: never`); later tables and functions were added by hand in the same shape. Replacing it with fully generated types is fine.
- Run the security and performance advisors after each migration. Expected findings today (checked 2026-10-03): `authenticated_security_definer_function_executable` for the 27 public write functions (intentional), unused indexes (empty database), `document_sequences` with no policy (intentional), leaked-password protection off (turn it on).
- **Applying through the Supabase MCP connector:** `apply_migration` waits for an interactive confirmation on destructive statements such as `DROP FUNCTION` and times out when nobody answers. Write migrations without drops (replace instead, as `20261003000100` does for `sync_ticket`), or apply them in the SQL editor.
- **Live project vs the migration files (checked 2026-10-03 by digest):** tables, columns, constraints, indexes, policies, grants, triggers, views and 62 of 71 functions are byte-identical. The other 9 (`build_tickets`, `confirm_locked`, `issue_bill_locked`, `recalc_order_totals`, `cancel_order`, `counter_sale`, `report_issue`, `reschedule_order`, `update_order_items`) differ only in SQL comments, which were left out when they were applied. Nothing to do; a later migration that replaces them brings the comments back.

## 5. Tests

| `supabase/tests/report_logic.sql` | `supabase/local/pglite` | 12/12 (2026-10-03, Phase 7): summary incl. CGST/SGST/taxable, money by method (deposit on an unbilled order), products, categories, sources, AC-35 totals against the bills and credit notes, India-time day boundaries, empty day, range checks, counter refused. Orders from 990501. |

Orders from 990401. |
| `supabase/local/concurrency-kitchen.sh` | run it | PASS (2026-10-03, before 5C). Needs `psql`; not rerun since 5C replaced `kitchen_guard` with `private.revise_tickets` (which takes the same order-then-tickets locks). |
| `supabase/tests/no_kot_logic.sql` | `supabase/local/pglite` | 5/5 (2026-10-09): unmapped made-to-order item confirms with no ticket, packs; chef PINs closed; live tickets and issues retired; retired order packs. Orders from 990901. |
| `supabase/tests/fulfilment_logic.sql` | same | 11/11 (2026-10-09): set-up needs an address and a time; collect stores none; Customer source needs name and phone, admin-only confirm; `set_fulfilment` validates, logs, refuses closed orders; counter sale is collect. |

| `kitchen_logic`, `revisions_logic`, `pin_logic` | — | **Deleted 2026-10-09** with KOT. `packing_logic` (now 20/20) and `orders_logic` (AC-06 now expects confirmation) were updated. |
| `web/src/lib/*.test.ts` (capacity, report, home, shell, orders, custom-cake, product-photo) | `npm test` | 26/26 (2026-10-09): pickup windows; report CSV and date ranges; collected-today; menu per role (no KOT, Customers for counter) and bell count; search scope, Customer list, green/red classes; cake details, size name, photo checks; product photo path. |
| `web/scripts/e2e/orders-4a.mjs` | Build, `npm start -- -p 3100`, create QA users (`supabase/tests/qa_users.sql`), then `QA_PW=... npm run e2e:orders` | 29/29 (Phase 4A) |
| `web/scripts/e2e/billing-4b.mjs` | Same setup, `npm run e2e:billing` | 17/19; the 2 failures are test-script issues (assertions depend on leftover data). Fix before relying on it. |

**Prefer the PGlite runner** (`cd supabase/local/pglite && npm install && node run.mjs`, section 3): it needs no PostgreSQL and touches nothing live. The results above come from it; the live project was compared with the migration files separately (section 4). **If you run SQL tests on the live project** through the Supabase MCP tool or any client that returns only the last result: replace the file's last two lines (`select … from r …; rollback;`) with
`do $$ begin raise exception E'RESULTS\n%', (select string_agg(check_name || ' => ' || coalesce(outcome,'NULL'), E'\n' order by n) from r); end $$;`
The error message then lists every check, and the exception rolls everything back. `supabase/local/mcp-bundle.sh <test> [migration…]` builds such a batch, with not-yet-applied migrations in front. The Supabase MCP server asks for confirmation on every batch that contains `DELETE`/`UPDATE` without `WHERE` or `DROP` (the test setup does), so prefer the PGlite runner. In the SQL editor, run the file as is. Compare each outcome with the `-- expect:` comment above it.

Caveats:
- The newer test files insert orders directly with high order numbers, so they do not consume `order_number_seq`. The older ones (`orders_logic`, `capacity_logic`, `billing_logic`) call `create_order` and **do** consume order numbers. Reset the sequence only while no real orders exist.
- The e2e scripts **commit data**. Run them against staging. Never run successful counter sales or bill issuing on the live project after launch: bills are permanent and consume real numbers.
- Some messages depend on the time of day: for example `orders_logic`'s "lead time violation" check reports the opening-hours message when run late at night.

## 6. Defaults chosen (owner has not confirmed)

| Default | Where to change |
|---|---|
| Business name **La Patisserie** (owner, 2026-10-03; set in Settings 2026-10-04). Bill prefix still `AB` | Settings |
| Custom cake GST 5% included in the staff price; HSN empty | Settings |
| Counter staff can take custom cake orders and edit the cake until packed; only an admin changes the price of a confirmed custom cake | `update_custom_cake` |
| Set-up has no extra charge (add a line if needed); the set-up time is the order's due time | Owner to confirm |
| Prices include GST; intra-state CGST/SGST split | Code (migrations 0200/0300) |
| Opening hours 9 AM–9 PM every day | Settings → Opening hours |
| Counter staff discount limit 10% | Settings |
| Counter staff can confirm in-store orders; only admins confirm call orders, reject, cancel, reschedule, refund, issue credit notes, or resolve kitchen issues | Migrations (role checks in functions) |
| Manual payment recording; no stock counts (owner, 2026-10-02). Pickup only **for now**: the owner wants delivery later (piece 6) | PRD section 2 |
| 5B: counter staff can pack and hand over orders (PRD: "Admin or permitted Counter Staff") | `mark_packed`, `record_handover` (migration `20261003000200`) |
| 5B: handing over with a balance due needs an admin and a credit reason (AC-10); a refund due does not block handover | `record_handover` |
| 5B: handover issues the GST bill when the order has none (PRD 5F: every completed sale gets a bill) | `record_handover` |
| 5B: only an admin can reopen a packed order, with a reason; it returns to Preparing (Confirmed when there are no kitchen tickets) | `reopen_packing` |

Also unconfirmed: the mock-up status colours (Pending pink, Confirmed blue, Preparing yellow, Ready and Completed both green); the owner was asked whether Completed should be grey. Business decisions still needed are listed in PRD section 14 and TODO Phase 0. The most urgent are: GSTIN/FSSAI/tax rates (check with the accountant), the real product list with kitchen mapping, opening hours, and the notification channel.

## 7. Known gaps and risks

- **Real flows not clicked through yet** (section 1). Print layouts have not been checked on a real 80mm printer.
- **The live site offers a demo admin login to anyone** (`DEMO_ADMIN_*` on Vercel) and holds demo data. Fine for showing the owner; remove both before real customers (TODO Start here).
- **Chef PIN sign-in is off on the live site** until `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` is set on Vercel; the secret key must be rotated before go-live (section 2).
- **No staging environment.** Production uses the only Supabase project. SQL logic is tested on PGlite; the app itself only runs against the live project. The free plan allows two active projects and the owner already uses one elsewhere.
- **Vercel missed one Git push** (2026-10-03, the 5C merge); later pushes deployed. After pushing, confirm a new Production deployment for the commit (section 2).
- Handover issues a GST bill when the order has none, which uses a bill number for good. Do not hand over test orders on the live project except as demo data that `remove_demo_data.sql` will remove.
- Packing is one confirmation per order; the itemized checklist and recipient checks are Release 1.1.
- The chef screen polls every 10 seconds (not Supabase Realtime); a tap that fails on the network shows "Not saved" and Offline.
- Look (section 18) leftovers: sidebar and bell counts refresh only on a full page load or refresh; the account menu does not close on Escape or outside clicks; the "coming soon" placeholders for Offers and Reviews open for counter staff by URL; 9 px tagline.
- `supabase/local/concurrency-kitchen.sh` (needs `psql`) has not been rerun since 5C.
- Leaked-password protection is off (Supabase → Auth → Password security).
- `next start` warns about `outputFileTracingRoot` (multiple lockfiles on the machine). Harmless.

## 8. Suggested order of work

0. **Ship the 2026-10-09 branch** (section 19): owner approves; apply migrations `20261009000100`–`0300` to the live project; merge `no-kot-custom-cakes` into `main` (Vercel deploys); click through the new screens.
1. **Piece 2 of the owner's mock-up: the Orders page** — status tabs with counts, search, date and order-type filters, rows with item photos (placeholder until piece 3), and the order detail opening beside the list with notes and the main next-step button. Brainstorm it from the mock-up (section 18), write a spec and plan as for piece 1.
3. **Piece 5: notifications** (the bell; today it opens the Dashboard) and, once the owner picks a channel, customer notification templates (PRD 5F proposes WhatsApp click-to-chat).
4. **Piece 6: delivery** — ask the owner for the rules first (charge, area, who delivers, "Out for delivery" handover).
5. **Owner steps:** add `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` on Vercel; confirm the 5B defaults and the status colours (section 6); supply business details (GSTIN, FSSAI, tax rates, products with kitchens, hours).
6. **Browser walkthrough of every flow** (owner wants it after the build work): admin and counter, chef on a tablet with PIN sign-in, the revision flow, packing and handover, prints. Consider Playwright (a headless-Chrome screenshot script was used for piece 1; it lives only in a session scratchpad, so rewrite it under `web/scripts/` if kept).
7. **Before go-live:** run `supabase/seed/remove_demo_data.sql`; delete `DEMO_*` on Vercel; rotate the secret key; create real admin and staff logins and disable the demo ones; enable leaked-password protection; staging and backups (Phases 7–8).
8. Public website (Phase 6, with Offers & Banners and Reviews) when the owner is ready.

## 9. Customer blocking and no-shows (built 2026-09-30)

Migration `20260930000100_no_shows.sql` (applied). PRD 5F "Spam and no-show protection".

- **Owner's decision:** recording a no-show does **not** change the order's status. Staff cancel or complete the order separately.
- **Database:** `orders.no_show_at`/`no_show_by` (each order counts at most once); `record_no_show` (admin and counter; orders with a customer, past pickup, in confirmed/preparing/ready/cancelled); `undo_no_show` (admin, reason); `set_customer_blocked` (admin, reason both ways); `customer_events` keeps every block and unblock with its reason.
- **Screens:** customer page `/admin/customers/[id]`; Blocked / N no-shows badges, Record no-show and Undo on the order page; a warning under the phone field on the new-order form (`src/components/customer-warning.tsx`).

## 10. Editing items on an order (built 2026-09-30)

Migration `20260930000200_edit_order_items.sql` (applied); `update_order_items(order, version, lines, reason, override_reason)`. The order page shows **Edit items** in the Items card.

- **Who and when:** admin and counter staff on draft and pending orders; admins only on confirmed orders, with a required reason. Never on preparing, ready or closed orders, or once a GST bill exists (credit note instead). Since 5A, also refused once any kitchen ticket is past New.
- **Lines:** the full new list. Existing lines keep their price snapshot; new lines take today's price; lines left out are deleted (the audit log keeps them).
- **Checks, only on what the edit adds:** availability (not overridable), preparation time, and daily caps for newly added categories; lead-time and cap refusals can be overridden by an admin with a reason.
- **Money:** totals recalculated; a discount keeps its rupee amount, capped at the new subtotal.
- **Timeline:** one `items_changed` event listing each change and the old and new totals; `tickets_revised` when kitchen tickets were rebuilt.
- Product search and quantity controls are shared with the new-order form (`src/components/catalogue-picker.tsx`, `src/lib/catalogue.ts`).

## 11. Kitchen tickets (Phase 5A, built 2026-10-03)

Spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-30-kitchen-tickets-design.md`; plan `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-30-kitchen-tickets.md`; migration `20260930000300_kitchen_tickets.sql` (applied as `kitchen_tickets`).

- **Tables:**
  - `kitchen_tickets`: one per order per kitchen; reference `B-1001-K1`; revision; status `new → acknowledged → preparing → ready`, or `cancelled`; pickup and start-by times; who/when for each step; stop-work acknowledgement; print count. No prices or customer data.
  - `kitchen_ticket_lines`: snapshot of made-to-order lines with ready counts.
  - `kitchen_issues`: problems reported by chefs, resolved by admins.
  - View `order_kitchen_progress`: `all_ready`, `open_issues`, `stop_work_pending` per order.
- **Access:** `private.can_see_kitchen` — admin and counter see all; chefs only their `staff_kitchens`.
- **When tickets are made:** in `private.confirm_locked` (both confirm paths). Ready-stock lines and counter sales get none. `private.build_tickets` rebuilds tickets when a confirmed order is edited or rescheduled **while every ticket is New** (revision + 1 only for tickets that changed; a kitchen that drops out gets a stop-work ticket that keeps its lines). Once any ticket is past New, `private.kitchen_guard` refuses edits and reschedules with kind `kitchen`.
- **Cancelling** an order cancels its tickets and raises a stop-work notice until a chef acknowledges it. Ready counts stay as a record.
- **Order status:** Confirmed → Preparing when any ticket starts. When every ticket is ready the order **stays Preparing** with an "All kitchen items ready" badge; packing then sets Ready (5B, section 13).
- **Screens:**
  - Chef screen `/kitchen`: Today / Tomorrow / Later, overdue first, source filter, kitchen switch, one-tap Ready, Part ready, Report issue, Print, stop-work notices, "Updated N s ago" / Offline banner.
  - `/admin/kot`: open issues with Resolve, stop-work list, tickets by day/kitchen/source/status.
  - Order page Kitchen card; kitchen badges in order lists and the calendar.
  - `/print/kot/[id]`: 80mm, COPY on reprints.
- **Refresh:** the chef screen polls a change stamp every 10 seconds and reloads only when it changed. Since 2026-10-03 the stamp is `public.ticket_stamp()`: a digest of the `updated_at` values of the tickets that can be on screen (still being worked on, or touched in the last two days), scoped to the chef's kitchens by row-level security. Every ticket write touches `updated_at`.
- **Since 5C** (section 14) `private.kitchen_guard` is gone: edits and reschedules revise acknowledged tickets in place instead of being refused.

## 12. Kitchen review fixes (built 2026-10-03)

Migration `20261003000100_kitchen_review_fixes.sql` (applied as `kitchen_review_fixes`); web commit `c8180e8`, SQL commit `79f28e8`.

- **One lock order** (order, then ticket): `lock_ticket` locks the order first; `kitchen_guard` locks the tickets it checks; `resolve_issue` goes through `lock_ticket`. Before this, an admin edit and a chef starting the same order's ticket deadlocked (reproduced and now passing in `supabase/local/concurrency-kitchen.sh`).
- The "Kitchen ticket ready" timeline entry carries the admin's reason when an admin acts as the kitchen (`sync_ticket(uuid, text)`; the one-argument form stays and forwards).
- `public.ticket_stamp()` replaces the count + newest `updated_at` stamp (which could miss a late commit and counted all history).
- Web: the chef screen goes to `/login` when the session is gone (401, or the proxy's redirect) instead of showing Offline forever; `/admin/kot` "Open" on today includes open tickets from earlier days; Part ready "Save" needs an admin's reason; cancelled tickets can be printed; the Resolve form catches network errors.

## 13. Packing and handover (Phase 5B, built 2026-10-03)

Spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-03-packing-handover-design.md`; migration `20261003000200_packing_handover.sql` (applied as `packing_handover`); commit `7399343`.

- **Columns on `orders`:** `packed_at`, `packed_by`, `packing_note`, `handed_over_by`, `collected_by`, `credit_reason` (`completed_at` already existed). `order_summaries` has them since `20261003000500`.
- **`mark_packed(order, version, note)`** (admin, counter): Confirmed or Preparing orders whose live kitchen tickets are all Ready and with no open kitchen issue → **Ready**. Ready-stock-only orders pack straight from Confirmed. Packing a Ready order again changes nothing.
- **`record_handover(order, version, collected_by, credit_reason)`** (admin, counter): Ready orders → **Completed**. A balance due is refused with kind `balance`; an admin retries with a credit reason through the shared `OverridePrompt` ("Hand over on credit"), and the balance at handover is recorded. Issues the GST bill if there is none. Handing over again changes nothing (AC-22).
- **`reopen_packing(order, version, reason)`** (admin): Ready → Preparing (Confirmed without kitchen tickets), packing record cleared, timeline keeps it.
- **Screens:** order page "Packing & handover" card (what is still missing, Mark packed, handover form with the balance, Reopen); Home "Ready for pickup" list with late collections; timeline entries Packed, Packing reopened, Handed over.
- **Not done (Release 1.1):** itemized checklist, recipient verification, partial collection, late/uncollected workflow beyond the Home list.

## 14. Kitchen revisions (Phase 5C, built 2026-10-03)

Spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-03-kitchen-revisions-design.md`; plan `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-03-kitchen-revisions.md`; migrations `20261003000300_kitchen_revisions.sql` and `20261003000400_kitchen_revisions_fixes.sql` (applied to the live project as `kitchen_revisions` and `kitchen_revisions_fixes`; the live function bodies were compared with the file by `md5(prosrc)`).

- **Owner's decisions:** a revised ticket keeps its status and ready counts and shows a change list the kitchen acknowledges; the chef keeps working. Lowering below the ready count caps it, with no waste record.
- **Columns:** `kitchen_tickets.pending_changes` (jsonb list of `{key, kind: quantity|notes|pickup, item, from, to}`; an added item is a quantity change from 0, a removed one to 0), `has_pending_changes` (generated), `changes_acknowledged_at/by`. Ticket lines may now be quantity 0 when cancelled. `order_kitchen_progress.changes_pending`.
- **Functions:**
  - `update_order_items` and `reschedule_order` now accept **preparing** orders (admin, reason); **ready** (packed) orders are refused with kind `kitchen` ("Reopen packing first"). They call `private.apply_ticket_changes`.
  - `private.revise_tickets` updates acknowledged, preparing and ready tickets in place (lines matched by `order_item_id`; ready counts kept or capped; new lines added; removed lines kept at 0 as cancelled; pickup moves recorded) and merges the entries into `pending_changes` with `private.merge_ticket_changes` (net change since the last acknowledgement; 2 → 3 → 2 leaves the list). `private.build_tickets` still rebuilds New tickets as in 5A and cancels kitchens with nothing left (stop-work).
  - An order line the kitchen has acknowledged is no longer deleted when it is left out of an edit: `cancelled_quantity = quantity`, value 0. Sending a removed line's id again is refused.
  - `public.acknowledge_ticket_changes(ticket, reason)`: the assigned chef, or an admin with a reason; repeats do nothing; timeline `ticket_changes_acknowledged`.
  - `mark_packed` refuses while any live ticket has unacknowledged changes. `sync_ticket` ignores cancelled lines; `set_line_ready` refuses them. Bills leave out fully cancelled lines.
- **Screens:** chef screen and order page show a "Changed · revision N" banner with the change list and **Acknowledge changes**; removed lines struck through; Ready tickets with changes stay on the chef's Active tab and sort first. Order page: Edit items and Reschedule on preparing orders, removed items struck through, a hint to reopen packed orders, the packing card names kitchens that have not acknowledged, the timeline lists each change. `/admin/kot`: "Awaiting acknowledgement of changes". Order lists and calendar: "Change unacknowledged" badge. Print: REVISED rN, the change list, removed lines.
- **Review fixes** (`20261003000400`): removed lines no longer count as already on the order for category caps; `acknowledge_ticket_changes(ticket, reason, expected_revision)` refuses (kind `conflict`) when the order changed again after the screen loaded, so a chef never clears changes they have not seen.
- **Review minors fixed** (`20261003000500`, 2026-10-03): `order_summaries.kitchen_ids` and the reschedule preview ignore removed lines; stop-work notices and prints leave out earlier-removed lines; an item added and removed before acknowledgement is deleted from the ticket; Ready tickets with changes show only on Active (chef) and once on `/admin/kot`; a ticket made Ready by an edit logs "Order changed: everything left was already made."; `report_issue` refuses removed items; pickup change entries are UTC text. `revisions_logic` 34/34.
- **Not done:** moving items between kitchens; waste or counter-sale records; edits on billed orders (credit note). Not yet walked through in a browser.

## 15. Daily sales report (Phase 7, built 2026-10-03)

Spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-03-sales-report-design.md`; plan `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-03-sales-report.md`; migration `20261003000600_sales_report.sql` (applied live as `sales_report`).

- **Owner's decision:** admins only.
- **`public.sales_report(from, to)`** returns JSON in paise: summary (bills, gross, discounts, billed, GST with CGST/SGST and taxable value for bills, credit notes and net (review fix `20261003000800`), credit notes, net sales = billed − credit notes), money by payment method (received, refunded), and sales by product/variant (from bill lines), category (bill line → order line → category) and source. Days are business-time-zone days; sales on `bills.issued_at`, credit notes on their own `issued_at`, money on `payments.recorded_at`. At most 366 days.
- **Screens:** `/admin/reports` with Today / Yesterday / This week (from Monday) / This month or custom dates; `/admin/reports/export` downloads the same report as CSV (UTF-8 with BOM for Excel; rupees with two decimals). Helpers and tests: `web/src/lib/report.ts`.
- Credit notes are not spread over products (they have no line detail); the product table says so.

## 16. Chef PIN sign-in on kitchen tablets (Phase 5D, built 2026-10-03)

Spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-03-chef-pin-signin-design.md`; plan `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-03-chef-pin-signin.md`; migrations `20261003000700_chef_pin_signin.sql` and `20261003000800_review_fixes.sql` (both live).

- **Owner's decisions:** admins set PINs (4–6 digits); tablets never lock by themselves; no lock-out after wrong PINs (they are counted per tablet and shown to admins). Accepted risk: a PIN works only on a registered tablet, so guessing needs the tablet itself.
- **Setup:** an admin opens Staff & Kitchens **on the tablet** → Kitchen tablets → *Register this browser as a tablet* (chooses the kitchen). That puts a random token in an httpOnly cookie (`kitchen_device`, 400 days); the database keeps only its SHA-256 (`kitchen_devices`). Then sign out: the tablet shows the chef picker (`/kitchen/pin`). Each chef row has *Set PIN* / *Reset PIN* / *Remove PIN*.
- **Sign-in:** the chef taps their name and types the PIN. The server (service-role key) runs `verify_kitchen_pin` (registered, unrevoked tablet; active chef of that tablet's kitchen; right PIN; `{ok:false}` for every refusal), opens a normal Supabase login for the chef without a password (admin `generateLink` + `verifyOtp`, nothing emailed) and records it by session id in `kitchen_pin_sessions`.
- **Staying valid (review fix):** `/kitchen` and `/kitchen/stamp` ask `kitchen_pin_session_status(session id, tablet hash)` on every load and 10-second poll: `none` = an email login, `ok`, or `invalid` (tablet revoked, PIN reset/removed, chef moved or deactivated, login used from another browser). Revoking a tablet or changing a chef's PIN also deletes those logins from `auth.sessions` (refresh tokens die; verified live). Invalid → `/kitchen/pin/end` signs out this device and returns to the picker. If the check itself fails (database unreachable), the chef stays signed in (availability).
- **Elsewhere:** `/login` on a registered tablet forwards to the picker (`/login?email=1` still offers email and password). Sign out / *Switch chef* end only this device's login. Without `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` the picker says PIN sign-in is not set up and nothing else changes.
- PIN hashes are in `staff_pins` (bcrypt via `extensions.crypt`): no policies, no grants, never in `audit_events` (PIN changes are logged as UPDATE/DELETE on `staff_pins` without the hash).
- **Review minors fixed** (2026-10-03, `20261003000900` and web): CSV text that starts like a spreadsheet formula (`= + - @`) gets a leading apostrophe; impossible custom report dates (2026-02-31) are refused before the query; an item added before acknowledgement and partly made stays as a Removed line when removed; the `database.types.ts` comment about `order_summaries` columns is corrected.

## 17. Home screen (completed 2026-10-03)

`/admin` (admin and counter): New in-store / call order, Open calendar, Open KOT; missing-routing alert; a **Kitchen needs attention** alert (changes not acknowledged, stop-work not acknowledged, open kitchen issues, tickets past start-by and not started); tiles for due today, awaiting confirmation, overdue and balance due today; due-today split (in-store, online/call, preparing, ready); **money collected today** for admins (payments minus refunds by payment date, the sales report's rule); one card per kitchen (open tickets, items to make, not started, late to start, past pickup, changes unacknowledged; links to `/admin/kot?kitchen=…`); ready for pickup with late collections; next 7 days; setup checklist. Figures: `web/src/lib/home.ts` (unit-tested).

## 18. La Patisserie look (piece 1 of the owner's mock-up, 2026-10-04)

Spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-03-la-patisserie-look-design.md`; plan `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-03-la-patisserie-look.md`. The owner sent a pink "La Patisserie" mock-up; it is being built in pieces: **1 look and shell (done)** → 2 Orders page like the mock-up → 3 product photos → 4 custom cake details → 5 notifications → 6 delivery (owner now wants delivery, reversing pickup-only; rules to be asked then). Offers & Banners and Reviews stay "coming soon" until the public website.

- **Brand:** La Patisserie, chef-hat mark and tagline (`Brand`, `ChefHat`, `ScriptText` in `components/ui.tsx`); business name in Settings set to La Patisserie on 2026-10-04 (new bills carry it).
- **Theme:** tokens in `globals.css` (brand `#c2456a`, chosen for 4.5:1 contrast with white text; `rose` `#e8789a` for decoration only; blush canvas; `note`/`note-line` sticky-note yellow for piece 4). Fonts: Playfair Display (headings, `font-display`), Great Vibes (`font-script`), Geist (body). Headings get the display font in the base layer, so a heading's own font class still wins.
- **Shell:** `components/shell/admin-shell.tsx` (client): icon sidebar (lucide-react 1.51.0, pinned) with count badges (Orders: awaiting confirmation; KOT: kitchen alerts), "Coming soon" group (`/admin/soon/<slug>`), cake photo footer; top bar with order search (`/admin/orders?q=&when=all`), bell (awaiting confirmation + kitchen alerts + late pickups, opens the Dashboard until piece 5), user menu with Sign out; phone drawer. Menu and bell rules: `lib/shell.ts` (unit-tested); counts: `lib/shell-counts.ts`.
- **Other screens:** login split layout with the patisserie photo; kitchen tablet and PIN picker branded with a script footer (tickets keep their sizes and contrast); status colours follow the mock-up (pending pink, confirmed blue, preparing yellow, ready/completed green, cancelled red).
- Photos from the original prototype are in `web/public/brand/` (resized).
- **Review fixes (2026-10-04):** top-bar search sends `scope=all` and finds orders in both lists, any status and date (`searchEverywhere`); phone menu is a modal `<dialog>` (focus, Escape, inert background); brand deepened to `#b93f63` (5.3:1 on white, 4.95 on the page, 4.51 on pale pink); account menu and badges have screen-reader names; coming-soon pages ignore names like `constructor`; printed bill and credit-note headings stay in the plain font. **Deferred:** badges refresh only on a full page load or refresh; counter staff can open the admin-only "coming soon" pages by URL (placeholders only); the user menu does not close on Escape or outside clicks; login script colour relies on CSS order; 9 px tagline; status colours now show Ready and Completed both green and Pending in brand pink (as in the mock-up), confirm with the owner.

## 19. No KOT, Customers, customer orders, custom cakes, photos, collect / set up (owner, 2026-10-09)

Spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-09-no-kot-custom-cakes-design.md`; plan `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-09-no-kot-custom-cakes.md`. Branch `no-kot-custom-cakes`.

**Owner steps to ship (in this order):**
1. Apply `supabase/migrations/20261009000100_customer_source_fulfilment_type.sql`, then `…0200_no_kot_custom_cakes.sql`, then `…0300_photos.sql` to the live project (SQL editor, or MCP `apply_migration`; 0200 contains `drop function`/`drop view`/`drop column`, which the MCP connector asks to confirm). Apply 0100 on its own first: a new enum value cannot be used in the transaction that adds it.
2. Merge the branch into `main` and push; check that Vercel makes a Production deployment for the commit.
3. Click through: new customer order, new custom cake order with photo and advance, the Custom cakes tab, a set-up order (red everywhere), the cake sheet print, a product photo, Customers as counter staff.
4. Former chef accounts: give them a counter role or untick Active on Staff (the page lists them).

**What changed**
- **KOT removed.** `private.build_tickets` and `private.apply_ticket_changes` do nothing; confirming and adding items no longer need a kitchen. The migration cancels live tickets without stop-work and resolves open issues (`private.retire_kitchen_tickets`, logs "Kitchen tickets retired"). Chef PIN and tablet functions are revoked. Web: `/admin/kot`, `/kitchen/**`, `/print/kot` and the kitchen libraries are deleted; kitchen fields left Products, Categories and Staff ("Staff" now: admin and counter logins); chef accounts are refused at sign-in and treated as signed out. Ticket tables and history stay in the database, unused.
- **Customers** is in KOT's place in the sidebar for admin and counter staff; only admins block or unblock.
- **Customer source** (`order_source` `CUSTOMER`, 💬): orders a customer sends in (WhatsApp, message). Call-order rules (name, phone, pickup time; admin confirms). In the **Online / Call / Customer** list.
- **Collect / set up:** `orders.fulfilment` (`collect` | `setup`) with `setup_address` (required for set-up) and `setup_note`; replaces the unused `fulfillment_type` placeholder. On every order form (`components/fulfilment-fields.tsx`); `set_fulfilment` changes it until the order is closed. Green rows/badges for collect and red for set-up on Orders, every Calendar view (with a filter), Dashboard; the order page has a big banner with Change; the handover button reads "Set up done"; bills and cake sheets print COLLECT / SET UP at the address.
- **Custom cake orders:** `/admin/orders/new-cake` (button on Orders and the Dashboard). Source in-store / call / customer; flavour, weight, tiers, theme, cream, filling, toppings, message, eggless, instructions; reference photo; staff price (GST from Settings, default 5%); optional advance recorded as a payment. One order line "Custom cake — 1.5 kg · 2 tiers" (no product), details in `custom_cakes`. Orders → **Custom cakes** tab. Order page: yellow sticky-note card (edit details and price until packed, add/replace/remove photo) and **Print cake sheet** (`/print/cake/[order id]`, 80mm or A4).
- **Product photos:** product page → Photo (admins). Thumbnails (or a pink cake placeholder) in Products, the order entry and order lines.
- **Photos and Storage:** buckets `product-photos` (public) and `custom-cake-photos` (private, signed URLs), JPEG/PNG/WebP up to 5 MB. The browser uploads straight to Storage with the staff member's session (storage policies check the role), then a server action attaches the file (`set_product_image`, `set_custom_cake_photo`) and deletes the replaced one. This keeps photos out of server actions (Next caps them at 1 MB, Vercel at about 4.5 MB).

- **Later the same day (owner):** **Counter Sale removed** (menu item and `/admin/counter`; the `counter_sale` database function stays, unused) and the **New customer order** button removed from the Orders page (customer orders can still be started from the new-order page's "Switch to customer" link, and custom cakes still take the Customer source).
- **Shipped 2026-10-09:** migrations `20261009000100`–`0300` applied to the live project (function digests compared with the files: identical), branch merged into `main` and deployed.

**Not done / to watch**
- Browser click-through of the new screens: not possible before the migrations are on the live project (the app has no staging database).
- `supabase/seed/demo_data.sql` and `supabase/local/concurrency-kitchen.sh` still use kitchen tickets; re-running the demo seed fails at its ticket steps (the live demo data is already loaded).
- A photo uploaded but not attached (network drop between the two steps) stays in the bucket as an orphan.

## 20. Custom cake extras and cake details on the calendar (owner, 2026-10-13)

Migration `20261013000100_custom_cake_extras.sql`. **Shipped 2026-10-13:** applied to the live project, merged into `main`, deployed.

- **New cake details** (`custom_cakes`): `theme` (now its own field), `design`, `model`, `fondant` (text, e.g. "Full fondant"), `has_cupcakes`, `has_popsicles`. On the new custom cake form, the order page's cake card (view and edit) and the printed cake sheet ("Extras: Cupcakes, Popsicles").
- **Set-up and delivery charges** (`setup_charge_paise`, `delivery_charge_paise`, optional, in the form's price section). A charge above zero is its own order line ("Set-up charges" / "Delivery charges", variant "Custom cake") at the custom cake GST rate and HSN from Settings, so totals, bills and balances include it. `private.sync_cake_charges` adds, re-prices or deletes the lines; `custom_cakes.setup_charge_item_id` / `delivery_charge_item_id` point at them. The advance is checked against the whole total. Only an admin changes a confirmed cake's price or charges; counter staff can still change its details.
- `create_custom_cake_order` now creates the order unconfirmed, adds the details and charge lines, then confirms if asked.
- **Calendar:** day and agenda rows show "🎂 flavour · weight · Fondant · Theme" under the customer name, with the set-up address; week chips show the same and the address; month cells count custom cakes.
- Checks: `supabase/tests/custom_cakes_logic.sql` C15–C22; `web/src/lib/custom-cake.test.ts`.

**Not done / to watch**
- Not yet clicked through on the live site.
- Owner to confirm the charges' GST (same rate as custom cakes, default 5%); delivery services are often taxed differently.
- Cupcakes and popsicles are ticks only, with no count (counts go in Special instructions).

## 21. Public website connected to the order system (owner, 2026-10-16)

The owner sent the finished static site (`la-patisserie-frontend.zip`, a newer version of `la pater/` with logos) and asked to connect it. Migration `20261016000100_website_orders.sql`; checks `supabase/tests/website_logic.sql` (18/18 on PGlite); `web/src/lib/website.ts` (unit-tested).

- **Where it lives:** `web/public/site/` (the owner's HTML, CSS and JS, kept as plain files so later versions can be dropped in). `next.config.ts` rewrites `/` to `/site/index.html`; the old `/` → login redirect is gone. Staff use `/login` (linked in the footer).
- **Products:** `script.js` loads `/api/site/catalogue` → `public.website_catalogue()` (anon): available products in active categories with available sizes, lowest price, photo, veg/egg and eggless flags; nothing staff-only. Cards replace the showcase cards; if the call fails or the catalogue is empty the showcase cards stay. Products without a photo get one of the site's photos.
- **Orders:** the form (name, phone, optional email, optional product and size from the catalogue + quantity, date and time, collect or set up with address, order type, message) posts to `/api/site/order` → `public.submit_website_order` (anon). The order arrives in Orders as **Online 🌐, pending confirmation**; an admin confirms, edits items or rejects it as usual. Requests with no product arrive with a total of 0 for staff to price (Edit items) or reject and re-enter as a custom cake order. The type, email and message go into the customer notes.
- **Checks:** opening hours and closures, lead time and capacity are enforced (no overrides from the website); blocked phones are refused; an existing customer's name is never changed by a visitor. Spam: hidden honeypot field, at most 3 waiting orders per phone and 30 website orders an hour in total. Retries with the same key return the same order.
- **Time zone:** the website reads dates in Asia/Kolkata (visitors cannot read Settings).
- **Not done:** the newsletter box does nothing; the contact section's hours (10 AM–8 PM) are typed into the HTML and differ from Settings (9–9 default); no confirmation message or email to the customer (staff call them); no order status page for customers (`orders.access_token` is reserved for it).
